    "<b>Abstract:</b> </br>\n",
    "The paradigm shift introduced by deep residual learning, as delineated in the seminal paper \"Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition\" by Kaiming He et al., has significantly propelled the performance benchmarks in computer vision, particularly in image classification tasks. This review offers an in-depth analysis of the deep residual learning framework, encompassing its core principles, architectural intricacies, empirical validations, and broader ramifications within the computer vision domain. It elucidates the conceptual underpinnings motivating residual learning, the structural composition of residual networks (ResNets), training methodologies, and empirical outcomes. Furthermore, the review elucidates the multifaceted impacts of deep residual learning beyond its immediate application in image recognition, while also delineating prospective research trajectories in this rapidly evolving domain."
